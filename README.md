## üß≠ Project Overview

This project analyzes the financial impact of a new shipping cost model (‚ÄúHypothesis Model‚Äù) compared to the existing Baseline Model.  
The goal was to evaluate how adjusting shipping cost logic for multi-item orders affects total shipping expenses, profitability, and order composition across U.S. regions.

The analysis combines transactional, product, customer, and state mapping data into a unified dataset and visualizes key findings using Tableau Public.

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Model and Transformation

All data preparation and feature creation were done via `data_preparation_shipping_models.sql`.  
The script performs cleaning, normalization, enrichment, and calculation of both shipping models.

### Data Sources

| Table | Description |
|:------|:-------------|
| `fact_sales` | Contains transaction-level data including product, quantity, sales, and price. |
| `dim_customers` | Includes customer locations (city, postal code, latitude, longitude). |
| `dim_products` | Contains product category, weight, landed cost, and shipping cost. |
| `state_region_mapping` | Maps nonstandard state names and codes to standardized state and region labels. |

### Key Transformations

- **Data Cleaning:** Normalized product descriptions, coerced quantity/sales/unit price consistency.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Created `profit_per_unit`, `baseline_shipping_cost`, and `hypothesis_shipping_cost`.  
- **Model Logic:**
  - Baseline Model: 100% cost for first item, 70% for additional items.  
  - Hypothesis Model: Progressive discount by quantity tiers (0.8 ‚Üí 0.3 factor).  
- **Profit Calculation:** Computed `profit_after_baseline` and `profit_after_hypothesis`.  
- **Granularity:** Each record represents a single invoice line (`InvoiceLine`).  
  In Tableau, measures were aggregated to invoice-level (`Order`) using LOD expressions for KPIs such as ‚ÄúOrders with Cost Reductions‚Äù.

## üìä Analytical Approach

Two interactive dashboards were built in Tableau Public.

### Dashboard 1 ‚Äì Model Comparison Overview

![Dashboard 1 - Model Comparison](dashboard_1_overview.png)

**Objective:** Evaluate average cost and profit differences between the Baseline and Hypothesis models.

#### Key KPIs

- **Total Savings per Order:** Overall shipping cost reduction per invoice under the Hypothesis model.  
- **Average Savings per Order:** Mean savings amount per order compared to the Baseline model.  
- **Orders with Savings:** Share of invoices where the Hypothesis model yields lower costs.  
- **Median Order Size:** Typical number of items per order, highlighting the relationship between order volume and savings potential.

#### Insights

- On average, 57% of all orders show lower shipping costs under the Hypothesis model.  
- Cost reductions are driven primarily by multi-item orders (‚â• 2 items).  
- Average savings per order are moderate in single-item orders but grow exponentially with order size.  
- Approximately 43% of orders show no difference, meaning both models yield identical costs.

### Dashboard 2 ‚Äì Regional and Product Breakdown

![Dashboard 2 - Regional and Product Breakdown](dashboard_2_regional.png)

**Objective:** Assess cost reduction patterns across U.S. states and product categories.

#### Visuals and Metrics

- **Choropleth Map ‚Äì Average Savings by State:**  
  Shows mean cost savings per order per state.  
  Color scale capped at $150 to prevent distortion from outliers.  

- **Bar Chart ‚Äì Top 5 States by Total Savings:**  
  Displays top-performing states by total savings.  
  Uses `SUM(total_savings)` per state, dynamically filtered by region.  

- **Heatmap ‚Äì Average Savings Patterns by Category and Region:**  
  Aggregates average savings across regions and product categories.  
  Color scale capped for readability to manage variability in outliers.

#### Insights

- The **East**, **Central**, and **West** regions contribute the majority of total savings, while the **Other** region trails significantly in cumulative savings volume.  
- However, average savings per order are highest in the **Other** region due to extreme outliers ‚Äî particularly the **Virgin Islands (VI)**, where average shipping savings exceed \$2,000 per order.  
- After adjusting for this outlier, average savings patterns align more closely with total savings distribution across regions.  
- Overall, the Hypothesis model demonstrates consistent efficiency across major regions, with cost reductions strongest in high-volume areas (East and Central).

## üìà Data Characteristics and Limitations

- **Period:** December 2020 ‚Äì December 2021  
- **Granularity:** InvoiceLine (later aggregated to Invoice for KPIs)  
- **Outliers:** Some locations (e.g., Virgin Islands) exhibit high average shipping costs; color scales capped for visual clarity.  
- **Neutral Orders:** About 43% of orders yield identical costs under both models.  
- **Geographic Coverage:** U.S. customers only.

## üí° Recommendations

### 1. Operational
- Adopt the Hypothesis Shipping Model, especially for multi-item orders.  
- Monitor outlier states with high costs.  
- Consider dynamic shipping discounts tied to order weight or category.

### 2. Marketing
- Promote bundled purchases to increase the share of multi-item orders.  
- Implement product recommendation logic such as ‚ÄúCustomers who bought X also bought Y.‚Äù  
- Use cost-efficient states for regional campaigns promoting ‚ÄúSmart Shipping Savings.‚Äù

### 3. Data and Analytics
- Introduce automated outlier detection for states and categories.  
- Integrate real shipping data to calibrate Hypothesis discount tiers.  
- Extend the model with margin sensitivity analysis per region.

## Example SQL Excerpt

Below is a shortened snippet from `data_preparation_shipping_models.sql` illustrating the model logic:

```sql
-- Shipping model logic example
CASE
    WHEN quantity = 1 THEN costs
    ELSE costs + (costs * 0.7 * (quantity - 1))
END AS baseline_shipping_cost,

CASE
    WHEN quantity = 1 THEN 1.0
    WHEN quantity = 2 THEN 0.8
    WHEN quantity <= 4 THEN 0.6
    WHEN quantity <= 7 THEN 0.5
    WHEN quantity <= 9 THEN 0.4
    ELSE 0.3
END AS hypothesis_factor
```

Full transformation logic is available in the main SQL file.
